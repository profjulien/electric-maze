Electric Maze Game Prototype with Timer and Reset
=================================================

This version of the Electric Maze game includes a 5-minute countdown timer and resets discovered cells upon hitting an incorrect cell.

Game Rules:
1. Navigate the maze by clicking cells to find the correct path from the green start cell to the orange end cell.
2. When a red (incorrect) cell is clicked, all discovered cells reset to grey, and players return to the starting point.
3. Each incorrect move adds a 10-second penalty to the remaining time.

How to Start:
- Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser to play.

Notes:
- This is a standalone prototype. Multiplayer functionality would require additional backend implementation.
