Electric Maze Game Prototype with Timer Pause, Reset, and Player Change
=======================================================================

This version of the Electric Maze game includes:
1. A 5-minute countdown timer.
2. Reset of discovered cells upon hitting an incorrect cell.
3. Pause and prompt to change players when an incorrect cell is clicked.
4. Resume with a 10-second penalty after any key is pressed.

Game Rules:
1. Navigate the maze by clicking cells to find the correct path from the green start cell to the orange end cell.
2. When a red (incorrect) cell is clicked, all discovered cells reset to grey, the timer pauses, and a message to change players appears.
3. After pressing any key, the game resumes with a 10-second penalty added to the timer.

How to Start:
- Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser to play.

Notes:
- This is a standalone prototype. Multiplayer functionality would require additional backend implementation.
