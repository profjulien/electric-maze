Electric Maze Game Prototype with Adjacent Path and Time Deduction Penalty
=========================================================================

This version of the Electric Maze game includes:
1. A 5-minute countdown timer.
2. Deduction of 10 seconds from the timer for each incorrect cell.
3. A continuous, adjacent path from the start to the end of the maze.
4. Game over when the timer reaches zero, or a win if the end is reached before time runs out.

Game Rules:
1. Navigate the maze by clicking cells to follow the adjacent path from the green start cell to the orange end cell.
2. When a red (incorrect) cell is clicked, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer, and all cells reset to grey.
3. If the timer runs out, the game is over. If the end cell is reached before time runs out, the team wins.

How to Start:
- Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser to play.

Notes:
- This is a standalone prototype. Multiplayer functionality would require additional backend implementation.
