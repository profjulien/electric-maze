Electric Maze Game Prototype
============================

This prototype is a simple grid-based game where players navigate a maze by clicking on the correct path.

How to Use:
1. Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on cells to find the correct path.
3. Correct cells will turn green; incorrect cells will turn red.

Customization:
- You can modify the maze size or random path logic by editing the JavaScript code in `index.html`.

Notes:
- This is a standalone prototype. For multiplayer functionality, additional backend development is required.
